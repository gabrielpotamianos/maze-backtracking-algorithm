# Reverse Backtracking Algorithm - Maze (Mouse Tracking Cheese)



![alt-text](https://github.com/gabrielpotamianos/maze-backtracking-algorithm/blob/main/gif/Maze.gif)

The project uses reverse backtracking algorithm to create the maze and to transverse the maze to get the cheese.
The basic idea:
- Check for neighbours
- Choose a neighbour (Constraints or Randomly)
- Continue the process until no neighbours
- Pop the stack until you have unvisited neighbours

The project is well commented so feel free to read through and modify as you may wish.
